# Archived Validation Refactoring Documents

This directory contains historical refactoring documents for the validation module. These documents have been superseded by the unified architecture document.

## Current Architecture

The definitive validation architecture is now documented in:
- **Primary**: `/code/modules/core_interfaces/docs/validation-architecture-unified.md`
- **Diagrams**: `/code/modules/core_interfaces/docs/validation-architecture-diagrams.md`

## Archived Documents

These documents represent the evolution of the validation architecture design:

1. **validation-refactoring-plan.md** - Initial refactoring plan
2. **validation-rule-refactoring.md** - Rule system refactoring
3. **validation-redesign-spec.md** - Latest redesign before unification
4. **validation-context-factory.md** - Factory pattern implementation
5. **validation-context-factory-plan.md** - Factory pattern planning
6. **validation-state-updates.md** - State management updates
7. **validator-refactoring-guide.md** - Validator implementation guide
8. **validation_result_cleanup_guide.md** - Result handling cleanup

## Why Archived?

These documents were archived because:
- Multiple overlapping documents created confusion
- Some design decisions were superseded
- Circular dependency issues required fundamental redesign
- Need for single source of truth

## Historical Value

These documents are kept for:
- Understanding design evolution
- Learning from past decisions
- Historical reference
- Audit trail of architectural changes

**Note**: Always refer to the unified architecture document for current implementation guidance.
