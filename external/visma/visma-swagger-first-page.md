# Visma eAccounting Swagger UI - First Page Content

*Fetched from: https://eaccountingapi.vismaonline.com/swagger/ui/index*

## Analysis

The first page contains JavaScript configuration for Swagger UI rather than the actual API endpoints. The configuration shows:

- **Root URL**: `https://eaccountingapi.vismaonline.com:443`
- **Discovery paths**: `swagger/docs/v2`
- **Supported HTTP methods**: `get|put|post|delete|options|head|patch`

## Issue

The WebFetch tool retrieved the Swagger UI configuration JavaScript code instead of the rendered API documentation. This means we cannot get the complete endpoint list from the first page alone.

## Next Steps

To get the complete list of endpoints, we would need to:
1. Access the actual OpenAPI/Swagger specification document at `/swagger/docs/v2`
2. Or use a tool that can render the JavaScript-based Swagger UI interface
3. Or continue with the partial extraction approach we used with Firecrawl

## Current Status

We have a partial list of endpoints from our previous Firecrawl extraction, but we cannot generate a complete "missing endpoints" list without access to the full API specification.
