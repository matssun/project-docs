âŽ¿ ValidationContext Architecture Transformation: System-Wide Gold Plan

    Executive Summary

    Transform the entire system from reactive input validation to proactive process validation with 
    ValidationContext representing complete business process state, eliminating all context creation 
    anti-patterns, and establishing process-aware error handling with intelligent recovery.

    Core Architectural Transformation

    1. Paradigm Shift: Process Validation Architecture

    From: Input validation with minimal error contextsTo: Business process validation with rich process state

    - ValidationContext = Business Process State Container
    - Process Success/Failure = Validation Success/Failure
    - Error Recovery = Process Recovery with Business Context
    - Context Hierarchy = Process Decomposition

    2. Anti-Pattern Elimination

    Removed: ValidationContext.create_minimal() method (completed)Effect: Forces proper ValidationContext 
    lifecycle management system-wideResult: No escape hatches for improper context creation

    System-Wide Implementation Plan

    PHASE 1: Foundation Architecture (Core Interfaces & Error Handling)

    1.1 ValidationContext Interface Refinement

    - Strengthen IValidationContext contract: Require rich process state
    - Establish context hierarchy protocols: Parent-child process relationships
    - Define recovery state interfaces: Process recovery decision support
    - Create context lifecycle contracts: Process boundary management

    1.2 Error Factory Integration Enhancement

    - Rich context extraction: Leverage ValidationContext's sophisticated state
    - Process-aware error creation: Use business process hierarchy for error correlation
    - Intelligent retry logic: Use ValidationContext state for recovery decisions
    - Error classification: Process-stage-aware error types and handling

    PHASE 2: Infrastructure Module Transformation (Current Focus)

    2.1 Persistence Infrastructure Context Propagation

    - Repository Interface Updates: All CRUD methods require validation_context: IValidationContext
    - Transaction Manager Integration: Context-aware transaction lifecycle management
    - Database Error Handling: Rich process context for database operation failures
    - Child Context Creation: Sub-transaction contexts from parent process contexts

    2.2 Service Infrastructure Context Flow

    - Service Registry Integration: ValidationFactory available system-wide
    - Event Handling Context: Process-aware event publishing and consumption
    - Configuration Validation: Infrastructure validated BY services, not self-validating
    - Component Lifecycle: Service components receive contexts from orchestrators

    PHASE 3: Business Process Context Ownership (Service Layer)

    3.1 Service Boundary Context Creation

    - API Endpoint Integration: HTTP requests create root ValidationContexts
    - Business Process Orchestration: Workflow managers own context lifecycle
    - Use Case Handler Integration: Business operations create and manage contexts
    - External Integration Points: Service boundaries for external system calls

    3.2 Process Decomposition Architecture

    - Parent-Child Context Hierarchies: Complex processes create child contexts
    - Process Stage Management: Context phases align with business workflow stages
    - Context Lifecycle Coordination: Service orchestrators manage context lifespans
    - Error Boundary Definition: Process failure points and recovery strategies

    PHASE 4: Advanced Process Patterns

    4.1 Distributed Process Context

    - Cross-Service Context Propagation: Microservice boundary context transfer
    - Async Process Management: Context serialization for queue-based processing
    - Context Correlation: Distributed tracing using ValidationContext hierarchy
    - Recovery Orchestration: Multi-service process recovery coordination

    4.2 Business Intelligence Integration

    - Process Analytics: Rich business process state for monitoring
    - Performance Insights: Context hierarchy for bottleneck identification  
    - Business Process Mining: ValidationContext data for workflow analysis
    - Predictive Recovery: Historical context patterns for proactive error handling

    Strategic Benefits & Long-Term Impact

    1. Business Process Visibility

    - Complete Process Traceability: Full business workflow execution audit trail
    - Rich Error Context: Errors include complete business process state and hierarchy
    - Business Rule Enforcement: ValidationProcess integration with business constraints
    - Process Performance Analytics: Detailed business process execution metrics

    2. Intelligent Error Recovery

    - Context-Aware Recovery: Retry decisions use full business process state
    - Process-Stage Recovery: Different recovery strategies based on process stage
    - Business Impact Assessment: Error severity based on business process context
    - Predictive Error Handling: Process patterns for proactive error prevention

    3. Architectural Excellence

    - Clean Separation of Concerns: Clear boundaries between validation, process, and error handling
    - Bottom-Up Architectural Enforcement: Lower levels force higher levels into compliance
    - Type Safety & Consistency: Rich typed interfaces throughout the system
    - Testability & Maintainability: Clear injection points and process simulation

    4. Development Experience

    - Rich Debugging Context: Complete business process state for troubleshooting
    - Architecture Guidance: Clear patterns for ValidationContext usage
    - Testing Infrastructure: Process simulation and context mocking capabilities
    - Documentation & Training: Comprehensive ValidationContext architecture guides
