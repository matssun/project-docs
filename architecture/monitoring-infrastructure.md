# Monitoring Infrastructure Architecture

## Overview

The monitoring infrastructure provides comprehensive observability for the modular Python platform. Following a recent unification effort, all monitoring components now reside within `service_infrastructure`, creating a cohesive system for performance tracking, health monitoring, and metrics collection.

## Unified Architecture

```

## Core Components

### 1. Performance Coordinators

Three coordination strategies for different scenarios:

#### DirectPerformanceCoordinator
- In-memory performance tracking
- Immediate metric availability
- Best for single-instance applications
- Zero network overhead

#### EventDrivenPerformanceCoordinator
- Publishes metrics as events
- Supports distributed monitoring
- Integrates with event system
- Enables real-time streaming

#### NoopPerformanceCoordinator
- Zero overhead implementation
- For production scenarios where monitoring is disabled
- Maintains interface compatibility

### 2. Metrics Collection

#### MemoryCollector
Provides in-memory metrics collection with:
- Counter metrics (incremental values)
- Gauge metrics (point-in-time values)
- Histogram metrics (statistical distributions)
- Timer metrics (duration tracking)

```python
collector = MemoryCollector()
collector.increment_counter("requests_total", {"endpoint": "/api/v1"})
collector.record_gauge("memory_usage_mb", 256.5)
collector.record_histogram("response_time_ms", 45.2)
```

### 3. Health Monitoring

Comprehensive health checking system:

```python
# Component health checking
health_manager = HealthCheckManager()
health_manager.register_check("cache", CacheHealthChecker(cache_manager))
health_manager.register_check("database", ConnectionPoolHealthChecker(db_pool))
health_manager.register_check("rate_limiter", RateLimiterHealthChecker(limiter))

# System-wide health status
system_health = health_manager.check_health()
```

### 4. Event-Based Monitoring

#### ValidationMonitoringService
External monitoring service that:
- Subscribes to validation lifecycle events
- Maintains zero coupling with core validation
- Provides performance metrics via events
- Supports pluggable monitoring strategies

#### PerformanceCoordinatorFactory
Factory pattern for creating coordinators:
- Supports multiple monitoring modes
- Configuration-based instantiation
- Maintains backward compatibility

## Integration Patterns

### 1. Service Registry Integration

All monitoring components register with ServiceRegistry:

```python
registry = ServiceRegistry()
registry.register(IPerformanceCoordinator, EventDrivenPerformanceCoordinator)
registry.register(IMetricsCollector, MemoryCollector)
registry.register(IHealthCheck, HealthCheckManager)
```

### 2. Event System Integration

Monitoring publishes typed events:

```python
# Performance events
performance.phase.start
performance.phase.end
performance.operation.complete
performance.metric.recorded

# Health events
health.check.completed
health.status.changed
health.component.degraded
```

### 3. Configuration Integration

Monitoring configured via `MonitoringSettings`:

```python
@dataclass
class MonitoringSettings(BaseSettings):
    mode: MonitoringMode = MonitoringMode.EVENT_DRIVEN
    enable_detailed_metrics: bool = True
    max_snapshots: int = 1000
    health_check_interval: int = 30
```

## Monitoring Modes

### 1. Disabled Mode
- Uses NoopPerformanceCoordinator
- Zero performance overhead
- No metrics collection
- Suitable for production with external monitoring

### 2. Direct Mode
- Uses DirectPerformanceCoordinator
- In-memory metrics storage
- Immediate metric access
- Best for development/testing

### 3. Event-Driven Mode
- Uses EventDrivenPerformanceCoordinator
- Publishes metrics as events
- Supports distributed systems
- Integrates with external monitoring

### 4. Custom Mode
- User-provided coordinator implementation
- Maintains IPerformanceCoordinator interface
- Full flexibility for specialized needs

## Metrics Types

### 1. System Metrics
- CPU usage
- Memory consumption
- Network I/O
- Disk usage

### 2. Application Metrics
- Request counts
- Response times
- Error rates
- Cache hit ratios

### 3. Business Metrics
- Validation success rates
- Processing throughput
- Queue depths
- Service availability

### 4. Performance Metrics
- Operation durations
- Phase timings
- Resource utilization
- Concurrency levels

## Health Check Categories

### 1. Component Health
Individual service component status:
- Cache availability
- Database connectivity
- Rate limiter status
- Connection pool health

### 2. System Health
Overall system status:
- Resource availability
- Service dependencies
- Performance thresholds
- Error rates

### 3. Business Health
Business logic health:
- Data consistency
- Processing backlogs
- SLA compliance
- Throughput targets

## Distributed Monitoring

### Event-Based Distribution
- Monitoring events published to Redis
- Consumers aggregate metrics across instances
- Real-time monitoring dashboards
- Historical trend analysis

### Trace Correlation
- Events include trace_id for correlation
- Cross-service performance tracking
- Request flow visualization
- Bottleneck identification

### Metric Aggregation
- Service-level aggregation
- Time-window rollups
- Statistical summaries
- Percentile calculations

## Best Practices

### 1. Performance Impact
- Use appropriate monitoring mode
- Disable detailed metrics in production
- Batch metric updates
- Implement sampling for high-volume metrics

### 2. Metric Naming
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Include relevant labels/tags
- Follow Prometheus naming guidelines
- Document metric purposes

### 3. Health Checks
- Keep health checks lightweight
- Implement timeouts
- Cache health status appropriately
- Provide detailed failure reasons

### 4. Event Publishing
- Use typed events only
- Include sufficient context
- Implement retry logic
- Handle backpressure

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Metrics
- Histogram with configurable buckets
- Summary statistics with sliding windows
- Exponentially decaying reservoirs
- HyperLogLog for cardinality

### 2. Distributed Tracing
- OpenTelemetry integration
- Span creation and propagation
- Trace sampling strategies
- Performance flame graphs

### 3. Alerting Integration
- Threshold-based alerts
- Anomaly detection
- Alert routing rules
- Notification channels

### 4. Monitoring UI
- Real-time dashboards
- Historical analysis
- Custom metric queries
- Alert management

## Migration from monitoring_infrastructure

The monitoring components have been unified into service_infrastructure:

### Before:
```python
from monitoring_infrastructure.performance import DirectPerformanceCoordinator
from monitoring_infrastructure.metrics.collection import MemoryCollector
```

### After:
```python
from service_infrastructure.monitoring import DirectPerformanceCoordinator
from service_infrastructure.monitoring import MemoryCollector
```

### Benefits of Unification:
1. Eliminates circular dependencies
2. Direct access to event system
3. Simplified dependency graph
4. Better integration with infrastructure components

## Conclusion

The unified monitoring infrastructure provides a comprehensive, extensible system for observability across the platform. Its event-driven architecture supports both local and distributed deployments, while the pluggable design allows for custom monitoring strategies. The tight integration with service_infrastructure ensures monitoring is a first-class concern throughout the system.
