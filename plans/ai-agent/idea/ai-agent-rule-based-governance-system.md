# AI Agent Rule-Based Governance System

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive approach to building a rule-based system that provides mathematical rigor and "solid proof" guarantees for AI agent behavior. The system extends existing validation infrastructure to ensure AI agents operate within explicit constraints with verifiable compliance.

## Problem Statement

> "It is obvious that you cannot trust the LLM in anything. Everything has to be guided by explicit rules and instructions and when an action has been performed you have to check that the action that was performed was according to the rules and instructions."

The core challenge is building a system where:
- **Every AI agent action** is validated against explicit, formal rules
- **Pre-execution validation** prevents invalid actions from being attempted
- **Post-execution verification** confirms actions were performed correctly
- **Mathematical proofs** provide formal guarantees of compliance
- **Complete audit trails** enable forensic analysis of all decisions

## Current Infrastructure Analysis

### Existing Strengths

Your codebase already contains sophisticated rule-based infrastructure that provides an excellent foundation:

#### 1. Comprehensive Validation Framework
**Location**: `components/common/validation/`

- **ValidationManager**: Single coordination point for all validation
- **Business Rules**: Domain-specific validation logic (`BusinessRule` class)
- **Rule Evaluation**: Constraint-based rule processing
- **Error Integration**: Seamless error handling through bridge patterns
- **XML/JSON Validation**: Structured data validation with schema support

#### 2. Development Rule Engine
**Location**: `tools/development-orchestration/development_orchestration/`

- **DevelopmentRuleEngine**: Configuration-driven rule system
- **Rule Factory**: Dynamic rule loading from config files
- **Phase-based Validation**: Different rules for different development phases
- **Agent Protocols**: Formal interfaces for agent behavior
- **Quality Assessment**: Code quality and architecture validation

#### 3. Agent Architecture Framework
- **Protocol-driven Design**: All agents implement formal protocols
- **Task Coordination**: Structured task delegation and tracking
- **Context Management**: Validation contexts flow through application layers
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management with context bridging

#### 4. Configuration-Driven Approach
- **YAML Templates**: Declarative project and rule definitions
- **Central Dependency Management**: Automated synchronization systems
- **Hook-based Automation**: Event-driven rule enforcement
- **Dynamic Rule Loading**: Runtime rule configuration updates

### Current Gaps for AI Agent Governance

#### 1. **Pre-Execution Action Validation** (Missing)
- No system to analyze proposed actions before execution
- AI agents can attempt invalid operations
- No formal specification language for intended actions

#### 2. **Mathematical Proof Generation** (Limited)
- Current validation provides pass/fail results
- No formal mathematical proofs of compliance
- Missing cryptographic evidence of rule adherence

#### 3. **Post-Execution Verification** (Basic)
- Limited system state comparison capabilities
- No formal verification of actual vs. intended outcomes
- Missing comprehensive evidence collection

#### 4. **Real-time Rule Enforcement** (Partial)
- Current hooks are file-based triggers
- No live monitoring of agent behavior
- Limited ability to interrupt non-compliant actions

## Proposed Architecture

### Phase 1: Formal Rule Definition Language

#### 1.1 Mathematical Rule Specification
Extend existing `IBusinessRule` interface with formal logic capabilities:

```python
class FormalRule(IBusinessRule):
    """Rule with mathematical guarantees."""
    
    preconditions: List[LogicalExpression]
    postconditions: List[LogicalExpression] 
    invariants: List[LogicalExpression]
    temporal_constraints: List[TemporalLogicExpression]
    
    def generate_proof(self, action: ProposedAction) -> MathematicalProof:
        """Generate formal proof of rule compliance."""
    
    def verify_execution(self, before_state: SystemState, 
                        after_state: SystemState) -> VerificationResult:
        """Verify actual execution against formal specification."""
```

#### 1.2 Rule Categories

- Network connections to unauthorized endpoints
- Resource consumption exceeding defined limits
- Actions that could compromise system security

**Correctness Rules** (Required Properties)

```python
class IntentAnalyzer:
    """Analyze AI agent proposals before execution."""
    
    def analyze_proposal(self, proposal: AgentProposal) -> AnalysisResult:
        """
        Parse LLM proposal into formal action specification.
        Validate against rule database.
        Generate proof of compliance or rejection.
        """
        
    def extract_preconditions(self, proposal: AgentProposal) -> List[Condition]:
        """Extract required preconditions from proposal."""
        
    def predict_postconditions(self, proposal: AgentProposal) -> List[Condition]:
        """Predict expected system state changes."""
        
    def validate_against_rules(self, action_spec: ActionSpecification) -> ValidationResult:
        """Validate action against all applicable rules."""
```

#### 2.2 Action Specification Language

Formal language for describing intended actions:

```yaml
action_spec:
  type: "file_modification"
  target: "/path/to/file.py"
  operation: "edit"
  preconditions:
    - file_exists: true
    - file_writable: true
    - backup_created: true
  postconditions:
    - syntax_valid: true
    - tests_pass: true
    - lint_compliant: true
  resource_requirements:
    max_memory: "100MB"
    max_time: "30s"
  risk_level: "medium"
```

### Phase 3: Post-Execution Verification Engine

#### 3.1 State Comparison Framework

```python
class StateVerifier:
    """Verify actual outcomes against intended outcomes."""
    
    def capture_state_before(self, action_spec: ActionSpecification) -> SystemState:
        """Capture relevant system state before action."""
        
    def capture_state_after(self, action_spec: ActionSpecification) -> SystemState:
        """Capture system state after action execution."""
        
    def compare_states(self, before: SystemState, after: SystemState,
                      expected: ActionSpecification) -> VerificationResult:
        """Compare actual changes to intended changes."""
        
    def generate_compliance_proof(self, verification: VerificationResult) -> ComplianceProof:
        """Generate mathematical proof of rule compliance."""
```

#### 3.2 Evidence Collection System

Comprehensive evidence gathering:
- **File System Changes**: Before/after snapshots, checksums, timestamps
- **Network Activity**: All connections, data transfers, API calls
- **Resource Usage**: Memory, CPU, disk usage throughout execution
- **Execution Traces**: Complete log of all operations performed
- **External Dependencies**: All external services or tools invoked

### Phase 4: Mathematical Proof Generation

#### 4.1 Formal Proof Engine

```python
class ProofGenerator:
    """Generate formal mathematical proofs of rule compliance."""
    
    def generate_safety_proof(self, action: ExecutedAction) -> SafetyProof:
        """Prove no safety rules were violated."""
        
    def generate_correctness_proof(self, action: ExecutedAction) -> CorrectnessProof:
        """Prove all correctness requirements were met."""
        
    def generate_completeness_proof(self, action: ExecutedAction) -> CompletenessProof:
        """Prove all required operations were performed."""
        
    def verify_proof_validity(self, proof: MathematicalProof) -> bool:
        """Verify the mathematical validity of a proof."""
```

#### 4.2 Compliance Certificates

Cryptographically signed proof documents:

```python
@dataclass
class ComplianceCertificate:
    action_id: str
    timestamp: datetime
    agent_id: str
    rules_applied: List[RuleID]
    mathematical_proof: MathematicalProof
    evidence_hash: str
    signature: cryptographic.Signature
    
    def verify_authenticity(self) -> bool:
        """Verify cryptographic signature and integrity."""
        
    def export_for_audit(self) -> AuditRecord:
        """Export certificate for external audit."""
```

### Phase 5: System Integration

#### 5.1 Agent Integration Points

Modify existing agent protocols to require rule compliance:

```python
class RuleCompliantAgent(DevelopmentAgentProtocol):
    """Agent that must comply with formal rules."""
    
    async def propose_action(self, context: TaskContext) -> ActionProposal:
        """Propose action with formal specification."""
        
    async def execute_with_verification(self, 
                                      approved_action: ApprovedAction) -> VerifiedResult:
        """Execute action with pre/post verification."""
```

#### 5.2 Integration with Existing Infrastructure
