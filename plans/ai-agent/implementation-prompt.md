# AI Agent Governance System - Implementation Prompt

## üéØ MISSION

You are implementing a **formal AI agent governance system** with mathematical rigor, comprehensive documentation, and zero tolerance for untyped data structures. This system will govern AI agent behavior through dynamic contracts with Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) verification capabilities.

```
1. Read: docs/plans/ai-agent/human-agent-governance-process-part1.md
   - Process Overview and Analysis
   - Executive summary and formal process templates
   - Current task analysis and verification results

2. Read: docs/plans/ai-agent/human-agent-governance-process-part2.md

   - Pay special attention to:
     * Object-oriented design enforcement (NO Dict[str, Any])
     * Validation system rules (ValidationManager patterns)
     * Import rules (NO conditional imports)
     * Error handling patterns (error_handling module integration)
   - These rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE

4. Read: docs/plans/ai-agent/testing-strategy.md
   - Testing Trophy methodology over Test Pyramid
   - AAA pattern requirements
   - Mock usage guidelines
   - Integration testing approaches
```

### Step 3: Understand Current Codebase

   - Development workflow
   - Project structure

6. Read: components/common/CLAUDE.md
   - Common components workspace architecture
   - Module dependencies and integration patterns
   - Critical development rules

7. Read: components/common/validation/CLAUDE.md
   - Validation system architecture (CRITICAL for implementation)
   - ValidationManager patterns
   - Info object ownership rules
   - Error handling integration
```

### Step 4: Study Your Assigned Task
```
8. Read your assigned task specification document in docs/plans/ai-agent/tasks/
   - Understand formal requirements (FR-X.Y.Z)
   - Review acceptance criteria
   - Note dependencies and integration requirements
   - Understand deliverables and success metrics
```

### Step 5: Verification Checkpoint
**STOP HERE** - Before proceeding, confirm you understand:
- [ ] The formal verification approach and LTL requirements
- [ ] Object-oriented design enforcement (zero Dict[str, Any] tolerance)
- [ ] ValidationManager-centered architecture patterns
- [ ] Your specific task requirements and acceptance criteria
- [ ] Testing strategy and quality requirements
- [ ] Architecture compliance requirements

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION RULES

### Architectural Compliance
- **ALWAYS** follow the dependency hierarchy: Foundation ‚Üí Core ‚Üí Infrastructure ‚Üí Domain
- **ALWAYS** use protocols from core_interfaces
- **ALWAYS** use error_handling module for ALL errors
- **ALWAYS** use ValidationManager as primary validation interface
- **NEVER** create circular dependencies
- **NEVER** bypass established patterns

### Object-Oriented Design Enforcement
```python
# ‚ùå FORBIDDEN - Will cause PR rejection
metadata = {"key": "value"}
config = {"setting": "value"}  
def process(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Any:

# ‚úÖ REQUIRED - Fully typed objects
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ExecutionMetadata:
    timestamp: datetime
    agent_id: str
    execution_duration: float

class AgentConfiguration(BaseModel):
    claude_model: str = Field(...)
    max_tokens: int = Field(4000, ge=1)
    class Config:
        extra = "forbid"
```

### Validation System Integration
- **ALWAYS** create ValidationManager once at service startup
- **ALWAYS** pass validation contexts down through application layers
- **NEVER** create ValidationManager at mid-level services
- **NEVER** use ValidationFactory/ValidationProcess directly
- **ALWAYS** let validation module create ALL Info objects and ErrorRecord

### Error Handling Integration
- **ALWAYS** use error_handling module for ALL errors
- **NEVER** raise raw exceptions (ValueError, etc.)
- **ALWAYS** provide complete error context
- **ALWAYS** integrate with validation system error bridge

## üèóÔ∏è IMPLEMENTATION METHODOLOGY

### Phase 1: Analysis and Planning
1. **Task Analysis**: Break down formal requirements into implementation steps
2. **Architecture Design**: Design fully typed objects and protocol interfaces
3. **Integration Planning**: Plan ValidationManager and error_handling integration
4. **Testing Strategy**: Plan comprehensive tests following Testing Trophy methodology

### Phase 2: Present Implementation Plan
**MANDATORY**: Present your complete implementation plan including:
- Fully typed data structures and protocols
- ValidationManager integration approach
- Error handling integration
- Testing approach
- File structure and module organization

**STOP AND ASK** if you have ANY questions about:
- Object-oriented design patterns
- ValidationManager integration
- Error handling requirements
- Testing methodology
- Architecture compliance

### Phase 3: Implementation
Only after plan approval:
1. **Create fully typed objects** (dataclasses, Pydantic models, protocols)
2. **Implement core functionality** following established patterns
3. **Integrate ValidationManager** following lifecycle patterns
4. **Integrate error_handling** for ALL error scenarios
5. **Write comprehensive tests** following Testing Trophy methodology

### Phase 4: Validation and Review
1. **Self-review** against coding rules checklist
2. **Run tests** and ensure ‚â•95% coverage
3. **Validate architecture compliance**
4. **Document implementation** with examples
