### Template 4: LTL Translation Guide

**Purpose:** Step-by-step process for converting natural language implementation plans into formal Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) specifications.

#### 4.1 LTL Fundamentals for Human Agents

**Basic LTL Operators:**
- **□ (Always/Globally):** Property must hold at all future times
- **◇ (Eventually/Finally):** Property will hold at some future time  
- **○ (Next):** Property must hold in the next time step
- **U (Until):** First property holds until second property becomes true
- **∧ (And):** Both properties must be true
- **∨ (Or):** At least one property must be true
- **¬ (Not):** Property must be false
- **→ (Implies):** If first property then second property

#### 4.2 Translation Process

**Step 1: Identify Temporal Constraints**

Extract temporal requirements from natural language plan:
- **Sequence constraints:** "A must happen before B"
- **Conditional constraints:** "If A occurs, then B must follow"
- **Persistence constraints:** "Once A is true, it remains true"
- **Eventual constraints:** "A will eventually happen"
- **Safety constraints:** "A must never happen"

**Step 2: Map Natural Language to LTL Patterns**

Common translation patterns:

| Natural Language Pattern | LTL Formula | Meaning |
|:---|:---|:---|
| "A must happen before B" | ¬B U A | B cannot occur until A has occurred |
| "A must always be followed by B" | □(A → ○B) | Whenever A occurs, B must occur next |
| "A will eventually happen" | ◇A | At some point in the future, A will be true |
| "A must always be true" | □A | A is true at all times |
| "A must never happen" | □¬A | A is never true |
| "A until B" | A U B | A remains true until B becomes true |
| "If A then eventually B" | □(A → ◇B) | Whenever A occurs, B will eventually follow |
