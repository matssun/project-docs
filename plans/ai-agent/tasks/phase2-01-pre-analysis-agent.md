# Phase 2, Task 1: Pre-Analysis Agent Implementation

**Duration:** Weeks 7-8  
**Milestone:** 2.1 - Pre-Analysis Agent  
**Priority:** Critical Path  
**Risk Level:** Medium

---

## Task Overview

Implement the ConfigurablePreAnalysisAgent that performs intent classification and request decomposition according to our formal Intent Analysis Framework. This agent serves as the entry point to the development lifecycle, transforming natural language requests into structured, analyzable requirements.

---

## Formal Requirements

### FR-2.1.1: ConfigurablePreAnalysisAgent Implementation
The system SHALL implement a ConfigurablePreAnalysisAgent that follows the BaseDevelopmentAgent pattern and integrates with the orchestration infrastructure.

### FR-2.1.2: Intent Classification System
The agent SHALL provide intent classification capabilities including:
- Primary intent categorization (development_task, analysis_request, system_modification)
- Secondary intent identification (quality_assurance, documentation, testing)
- Complexity level assessment (simple, moderate, complex, multi-phase)
- Domain focus determination based on module analysis

### FR-2.1.3: Request Decomposition Engine
The agent SHALL decompose complex requests into structured components:
- Core requirements extraction from natural language
- Implicit assumption identification and documentation
- Dependency requirements analysis and mapping
- Success criteria definition and validation

### FR-2.1.4: Contract-Driven Behavior
The agent SHALL operate according to YAML-defined contracts with:
- Dynamic contract loading and validation
- Precondition, pathcondition, and postcondition enforcement
- Performance requirement compliance
- LTL constraint satisfaction
