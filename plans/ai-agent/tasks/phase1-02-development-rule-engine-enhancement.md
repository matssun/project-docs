# Phase 1, Task 2: DevelopmentRuleEngine Enhancement

**Duration:** Weeks 3-4  
**Milestone:** 1.2 - DevelopmentRuleEngine Enhancement  
**Priority:** Critical Path  
**Risk Level:** Medium

---

## Task Overview

Enhance the existing DevelopmentRuleEngine with orchestration capabilities to implement the GoverningDevelopmentRuleEngine. This system will serve as the central orchestrator for the AI agent governance system, managing agent lifecycles, workflow coordination, and state persistence.

---

## Formal Requirements

### FR-1.2.1: Governing Agent Implementation
The system SHALL implement `GoverningDevelopmentRuleEngine` that extends the existing `DevelopmentRuleEngine` with orchestration capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility.

### FR-1.2.2: Agent Lifecycle Management
The system SHALL provide comprehensive agent lifecycle management including:
- Dynamic agent loading and configuration
- Agent coordination and communication protocols
- State management across agent interactions
- Resource allocation and cleanup

### FR-1.2.3: Workflow Orchestration Engine
The system SHALL implement workflow orchestration with:
- Sequential and parallel task execution
- Phase transition validation and control
- Workflow state persistence and recovery
- Error handling and graceful degradation

### FR-1.2.4: State Management System
The system SHALL provide persistent state management for:
- Orchestration state across workflow phases
- Agent interaction history and audit trails
- Workflow configuration and context
- Performance metrics and monitoring data
